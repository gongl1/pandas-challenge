My 3 trends summary: 

1. The most popular item in terms of Purchase Count and Total Purchase Value is 92 Final Critic. 
2. 20-24 year olds makes up 44.79% of the players and has the highest Total Purchase Value. However, 35-39 year olds has the highest Avg Total Purchase per Person which makes sense since they are established in life and have extra $. 
3. Male-identifying customers make up 84.03% of the customer base. But they are spending 8.95% less than female-identifying customers based on Avg Total Purchase per Person. (4.47-4.07)/4.47=8.95%
Extra: The average unit price is $3.05. 20-24 year olds' Average Purchase Price is also $3.05. Their % of purchases compared to total salees is 46.81% which exceeds 44.79%, their percentage among total players. So I would target this group for potential more sales.
